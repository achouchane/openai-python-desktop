AI Chatbot using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo or GPT-4
This Python script creates a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for interacting with an AI chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model. The chatbot engages in a conversation with the user through a text-based interface.

Functionality
User Input and Display

The GUI allows the user to input text through a text entry field.
Communication with the Chatbot

When the user enters a message and clicks the "Communicate" button, the message is displayed as "You: [user's message]".
The message is then sent to the GPT-3.5 Turbo model using the OpenAI API to generate a response.
Chat Display

The conversation between the user and the chatbot is displayed in a text box.
The chat history, including both the user's and the assistant's messages, is stored and updated.
Assistant Response

The chatbot's response is displayed as "Assistant: [assistant's response]" in the chat display.
How to Use
Obtain OpenAI API Key

Replace "MY_OPENAI_API_KEY" with your actual OpenAI API key to authenticate and access the GPT-3.5 Turbo model.
Run the Script

Run the Python script, and a GUI window titled "AI Chatbot" will appear.
Interact with the Chatbot

Type your message in the text entry field and press the "Communicate" button.
The chatbot will respond, and the conversation will be displayed in the chat display.
